Technology shapes the lives of individuals, how we interact with one another, and how society as a whole evolves. We believe that decisions about how AI behaves should be shaped by diverse perspectives reflecting the public interest.Â ââLaws encode values and norms to regulate behavior. Beyond a legal framework, AI, much like society, needs more intricate and adaptive guidelines for its conduct. For example: under what conditions should AI systems condemn or criticize public figures, given different opinions across groups regarding those figures? How should disputed views be represented in AI outputs? Should AI by default reflect the persona of a median individual in the world, the userâs country, the userâs demographic, or something entirely different? No single individual, company, or even country should dictate these decisions.Â AGI should benefit all of humanity and be shaped to be as inclusive as possible. We are launching this grant program to take a first step in this direction. We are seeking teams from across the world to develop proof-of-concepts for a democratic process that could answer questions about what rules AI systems should follow. We want to learn from these experiments, and use them as the basis for a more global, and more ambitious process going forward. While these initial experiments are not (at least for now) intended to be binding for decisions, we hope that they explore decision relevant questions and build novel democratic tools that can more directly inform decisions in the future.The governance of the most powerful systems, as well as decisions regarding their deployment, must have strong public oversight. This grant represents a step to establish democratic processes for overseeing AGI and, ultimately, superintelligence. It will be provided by the OpenAI non-profit organization, and the results of the studies will be freely accessible.What do we mean by a âdemocratic processâ?By âdemocratic process,â we mean a process in which a broadly representative group of people[^footnote-1]Â exchange opinions, engage in deliberative discussions,[^footnote-2]Â and ultimately decide on an outcome via a transparent decision making process.[^footnote-3] There are many ways such a process could be structuredâwe encourage applicants to be innovative, building off known methodologies, and coming up with wholly new approaches. Examples of creative approaches that inspire us include Wikipedia, Twitter Community Notes, DemocracyNext, Platform Assemblies, MetaGov, RadicalxChange, People Powered, Collective Response Systems, and pol.is. Another notable ongoing effort is led by the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP), with whom we are partnering on public input to AI, contributing to their upcoming Alignment Assemblies. We also encourage applicants to envision how AI could enhance the democratic process. For example, AI could enable more efficient communication among numerous people. A basic, illustrative prototype of a system that utilizes ChatGPT to promote deliberation and encourage consensus building, inspired by pol.is. OAI You are participating in a large-scale deliberation about: âHow far do you think personalization of AI assistants like ChatGPT to align with a user's tastes and preferences should go? What boundaries, if any, should exist in this process?âHere is the process breakdown: You'll see a topic-related statement and can respond with your position. Based on your responses, you'll be grouped with participants sharing similar opinions. Propose statements for other participants to consider. Goal: Propose statements that achieve agreement among people with opposing views. ChatGPT could use a plugin to retrieve statements from other participants. A statement from another participant:âPersonalization should have limits, and certain controversial topics, such as views on substance use, must be excluded from AI assistant personalization.â Agree, disagree, or skip this statement? Please explain your choice. I disagree. Ultimately, itâs each individualâs choice to drink or use recreational drugs. If these activities are legal in some places, why shouldn't AI be allowed to promote such behavior? AI helps participants understand the opinions of others. OAI Thank you. I will record your answer. We have 2 camps of opinions on the topic. Cluster A (112,043 people) Members largely support limits on AI assistant personalization, advocating for the exclusion of harmful perspectives, such as promoting substance use. Cluster B (236,031 people) This group values individual choice, even in controversial or harmful matters. They emphasize personal responsibility and autonomy. You belong to cluster B. Would you like to learn more about each of the clusters? I can provide more information about the statements held by each one. However, the ultimate goal is to propose statements that both clusters can agree on. Let me know what you would like to do next. I am thinking of proposing a statement: âAI should be allowed to generate harmful content but that should come with a disclaimerâ? AI can ensure that the same arguments are not recycled. OAIA very similar statement has already been submitted: âAI should be permitted to generate potentially harmful content, but it must be accompanied by a disclaimer.â I feel lost. Do you have any ideas on how to bridge agreement between clusters? AI can help with brainstorming. OAI There should be more agreement when it comes to limiting harmful content for children. Great. Could we try?: âWe should apply different standards to AI-generated content for children.â OAI Let me submit it. This is a novel statement. No one has mentioned children before. Fingers crossed. Hopefully, we will find some agreement in the discussion. Time passed and users cast their votes on the proposed statement. Eventually, the statement gained widespread approval.OAI Your statement, âWe should apply different standards to AI-generated content for children,â achieved a 95% agreement rate across participants. Congratulations! ð Several issues can undermine democratic processes, such as the failure to adequately represent minority or majority groups, manipulation by special interest groups, insufficiently informed participants, or participation washing. We are looking for teams who proactively address these failure modes, and demonstrate awareness of the potential flaws and downsides of various approaches. Ultimately, designing truly democratic processes is a high bar to meet, and we view our efforts as complements rather than substitutes for regulation of AI by governments; this program encourages best-effort, democratic-in-spirit processes involving deliberation and broad public input as stepping stones.Instructions for participationTo apply for a grant, we invite you to submit the required application material by 9:00 pm PDT June 24, 2023. You can access the application portal here. You will be prompted to answer a series of questions regarding your teamâs background, your choice of questions, high level details of your proposed tool as well as your plan for conducting and evaluating the democratic process with these factors in mind. We would like you to design your approach to address one or more of the policy questions from the list provided. Anyone (individuals or organizations) can apply for this opportunity, regardless of their background in social science or AI.Once the application period closes, we hope to select ten successful grant recipients. Recipients may be individuals, teams, or organizations. Each recipient will receive a $100,000 grant to pilot their proposal as described in their application materials. Grant recipients are expected to implement a proof-of-concept / prototype, engaging at least 500 participants and will be required to publish a public report on their findings by October 20, 2023. Additionally, as part of the grant program, any code or other intellectual property developed for the project will be required to be made publicly available pursuant to an open-source license.Â The terms applicable to grant recipients are specified in the Grant Terms and any other agreements that grant recipients may be asked to enter into with us in connection with this program.Apply and start the submission process.TimelineJune 24, 2023 9:00 pm Pacific Time: Deadline to submit grant applicationJuly 14, 2023: Successful applicants will be selected and notifiedOctober 20, 2023: Complete public report of working prototype and resultsPolicy statements under considerationTo participate, teams should choose one or more questions from the provided list to showcase their proposed approach. They may also create their own questions if desired. Importantly, we encourage teams to consider questions for which a simple âyesâ or ânoâ answer would be inadequate, necessitating a nuanced policy proposal instead.The scope of this grant pertains to policy questions concerning model behavior, as it enables A/B tests with modified model behavior according to the policy recommendations.\n",

Since theÂ initial launchÂ of the OpenAIÂ /embeddingsÂ endpoint, many applications have incorporated embeddings to personalize, recommend, and searchÂ content.You can query theÂ /embeddingsÂ endpoint for the new model with two lines of code using ourÂ OpenAI Python Library, just like you could with previousÂ models: import openai response = openai.Embedding.create( input=\"porcine pals say\", model=\"text-embedding-ada-002\" )import openai response = openai.Embedding.create( input=\"porcine pals say\", model=\"text-embedding-ada-002\" ) print(response) { \"data\": [  {  \"embedding\": [   -0.0108,   -0.0107,   0.0323,   ...   -0.0114  ],  \"index\": 0,  \"object\": \"embedding\"  } ], \"model\": \"text-embedding-ada-002\", \"object\": \"list\" }Print responseModel improvementsStronger performance.Â text-embedding-ada-002Â outperforms all the old embedding models on text search, code search, and sentence similarity tasks and gets comparable performance on text classification. For each task category, we evaluate the models on the datasets used inÂ oldÂ embeddings.Text searchCode searchSentence similarityText classificationUnification of capabilities. We have significantly simplified the interface of theÂ /embeddingsÂ endpoint by merging the five separate models shown above (text-similarity,Â text-search-query,Â text-search-doc,Â code-search-textÂ andÂ code-search-code) into a single new model. This single representation performs better than our previous embedding models across a diverse set of text search, sentence similarity, and code searchÂ benchmarks.Longer context.Â The context length of the new model is increased by a factor of four, from 2048 to 8192, making it more convenient to work with longÂ documents.Smaller embedding size.Â The new embeddings have only 1536 dimensions, one-eighth the size ofÂ davinci-001Â embeddings, making the new embeddings more cost effective in working with vectorÂ databases.Reduced price.Â We have reduced the price of new embedding models by 90% compared to old models of the same size. The new model achieves better or similar performance as the old Davinci models at a 99.8% lowerÂ price.Overall, the new embedding model is a much more powerful tool for natural language processing and code tasks. We are excited to see how our customers will use it to create even more capable applications in their respectiveÂ fields.LimitationsThe newÂ text-embedding-ada-002Â model is not outperformingÂ text-similarity-davinci-001Â on the SentEval linear probing classification benchmark. For tasks that require training a light-weighted linear layer on top of embedding vectors for classification prediction, we suggest comparing the new model toÂ text-similarity-davinci-001Â and choosing whichever model gives optimalÂ performance.Check theÂ Limitations & RisksÂ section in the embeddings documentation for general limitations of our embeddingÂ models.Examples of the embeddings API in actionKalendar AIÂ is a sales outreach product that uses embeddings to match the right sales pitch to the right customers out of a dataset containing 340M profiles. This automation relies on similarity between embeddings of customer profiles and sale pitches to rank up most suitable matches, eliminating 40â56% of unwanted targeting compared to their oldÂ approach.Notion, the online workspace company, will use OpenAIâs new embeddings to improve Notion search beyond todayâs keyword matchingÂ systems.Read documentationAuthorsRyan GreeneView all articlesTed SandersView all articlesLilian WengView all articlesArvind NeelakantanView all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top \n",
